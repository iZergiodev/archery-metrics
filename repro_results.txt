--- Reproduction Results (Base Case) ---
Calculated FPS: 276.42 (Expected: ~276.36)
Total Arrow Weight: 341.90 (Expected: ~341.90)
Dynamic Spine: 0.409 (Expected: ~0.406)
Match Index: 0.937
Status: good

--- Point Weight Sensitivity Test ---
Base Point Weight: 110gr -> Dynamic Spine: 0.409
Heavy Point Weight: 150gr -> Dynamic Spine: 0.419
VERDICT: Increasing point weight INCREASED dynamic spine value (Weaker behavior). [CORRECT direction for deflection]
