--- Reproduction Results (Base Case) ---
Calculated FPS: 276.34 (Expected: ~276.36)
Total Arrow Weight: 341.90 (Expected: ~341.90)
Dynamic Spine: 0.408 (Expected: ~0.406)
Match Index: 0.901
Status: good

--- Point Weight Sensitivity Test ---
Base Point Weight: 110gr -> Dynamic Spine: 0.408
Heavy Point Weight: 150gr -> Dynamic Spine: 0.382
VERDICT: Increasing point weight DECREASED dynamic spine value (Stiffer behavior). [INCORRECT direction]
